                        <p>Originally from the beautiful mountains of Kyrgyzstan, I relocated to Washington, USA in Fall 2024 to pursue my technological aspirations and embrace new opportunities in this dynamic environment.</p>
                        <p>My vision is to develop innovative EdTech and FinTech startups that empower individuals to realize their potential while contributing positively to society. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring diverse cultures, reading thought-provoking books, staying active through running, and following football matches that combine strategy and teamwork—values I bring to my engineering work as well.</p>

                    <summary>Where I Came From</summary>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Kyzyl-Kiya and raised in Uckurgon, two vibrant hometowns filled with love, beauty, and warm-hearted people. My family wasn’t wealthy in terms of money, but we were rich in faith, values, and kindness. From a young age, my parents taught me to pursue my dreams, be respectful, and treat everyone with compassion. As the youngest child, I was full of energy—sometimes a bit too much! I attended the same school as my siblings, where I excelled academically, often earning straight A’s, but I wasn’t afraid to roughhouse with the boys after class. I was both the “good kid” and the mischievous one (haha). 
                        
                    <p> The school’s rigorous education system, where I studied for 11 years, built a strong foundation for my future.

                    <p> At 15, I moved to Bishkek, the capital city, for 2.5 years, studying at School No. 29. The move to a bigger city was a game-changer, opening up countless opportunities. In March 2022, I joined the ILGERI team, a group dedicated to promoting cultural heritage and information through modern technology in engaging ways. As a CEO and Project Manager assistant, I supported various initiatives, gaining invaluable experience. At just 16, I launched my first online clothing brand inspired by Kyrgyz culture, securing $500 in investment from Kulikov’s CEO—an exciting milestone!

During my final year of high school, I began preparing applications for universities abroad. 
                        
                    <p> My hard work paid off with waitlist offers from UPenn, Stanford, Brown, Duke, and Yale, and acceptances to WashU, Grinnell, Stetson, and Skidmore with 60–80% scholarships. However, I felt these offers didn’t fully meet my goals, so I chose to take a gap year to strengthen my applications. During that year, I taught myself Data Science and coding, sharpening my technical skills.

In 2024, I applied again and received similar results. After careful consideration, I enrolled at Bellevue Community College, located in the second-largest tech hub after California, with plans to transfer to the University of Washington in Seattle. That summer, I landed my first internship as a Machine Learning Engineer at Yandex, working remotely on exciting projects like feedback-responding AI, fraud detection models, and more. These experiences have fueled my ambition and shaped my path forward.

                    <summary>Where I Am Right Now</summary>
                    <p>
                        I arrived in Bellevue, USA, on August 30, 2024, to pursue my dreams. The transition was challenging at first—I struggled with homesickness and wondered if this path was right for me. However, I persevered and found an incredible group of friends who have supported me in life, education, and my career. Their encouragement helped me settle in and thrive.

                    <p> Recently, I completed Nfactorial’s six-month Data Science bootcamp, earning a gold certificate—an achievement I’m proud of. Currently, I’m focused on building machine learning models to deepen my expertise and grow as a programmer. My goal is to become an exceptional programmer, not just someone who passes interviews. At Bellevue College, I’ve maintained a 3.6 GPA while taking rigorous courses like Calculus 1–3, Linear Algebra, CS210–211, and Physics.

                    <p> Looking ahead, I’m seeking internship opportunities at Y Combinator startups or other high-growth companies with pre-seed funding of $1M or more, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue learning.

                    <summary>Where I Want to Go</summary>
                    <p>
                        My goal isn’t simply to land an IT job at a big company—that’s a milestone, not my ultimate dream. Instead, I aspire to build EdTech and FinTech startups that empower people to unlock their potential early in life. I believe everyone has unique talents, but not everyone gets the chance to discover them. I want to be the person who helps even just one individual transform their life by finding their purpose.

                    <p> By age 25, I aim to join Y Combinator, secure $10M+ in pre-seed funding for my EdTech startup, and grow it into a unicorn within three years. My EdTech platform will be an engaging website where high school students can craft their university applications while developing their personal strengths. Through interactive project-building tools, the platform will make the application process dynamic, helping students discover their talents and create impactful projects that reflect their unique “hero” journeys.

                    <p> Later in life, I envision returning to Bishkek to open a farm and café, creating a space to connect with my community. I also plan to share my knowledge and experiences on YouTube, inspiring others to pursue their dreams and make a difference.

Building a machine learning model to predict credit approval based on customer background documents, optimized with Optuna and Random Forest, is a solid project. An accuracy of 88% is a great starting point, especially for a complex task like this.</p>
